The 'DeepLearningonepage.pdf' is the specific page from deep learning textbook.   
The 'DeepLearningonepage.txt' is a txt file that is converted from 'DeepLearningonepage.pdf' file. But we can see that there are some unreadable code in that because the fomulas cannot be converted to comprehensible word well. Thus we use GPT-4 model to obtain the material content.   
The 'manyformula.pdf' is also one page from the same textbook, but this file contains many formulas. We test it in our system considering that the different situations are processed in GPT model.   
And the 'manyformula.txt' is the txt file that is converted using python.   
The 'Final project code_G66.ipynb' is the coding file of our work including txt recognitzation, teacher assistant, student assistant and result visualization.
