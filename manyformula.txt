2.5 Proof of the four fundamental equations (optional)

2

We’ll now prove the four fundamental equations (BP1)–(BP4). All four are consequences of
the chain rule from multivariable calculus. If you’re comfortable with the chain rule, then I
strongly encourage you to attempt the derivation yourself before reading on.

Let’s begin with Equation (BP1), which gives an expression for the output error, δl . To

prove this equation, recall that by deﬁnition

δ L

j =

∂ C
∂ z L
j

.

(2.14)

Applying the chain rule, we can re-express the partial derivative above in terms of partial
derivatives with respect to the output activations,

δ L

j =

(cid:88)

k

∂ C
∂ a L
k

∂ a L
k
∂ z L
j

,

(2.15)

where the sum is over all neurons k in the output layer. Of course, the output activation a L
k
of the k-th neuron depends only on the weighted input z L
j for the j-th neuron when k = j.
And so ∂ a L
= j. As a result we can simplify the previous equation to
k

j vanishes when k

/∂ z L

δ L

j =

∂ C
∂ a L
j

∂ a L
j
∂ z L
j

.

Recalling that a L
equation becomes

j = σ(z L

j ) the second term on the right can be written as σ

δ L

j =

∂ C
∂ a L
j

σ

(cid:48)(z L

j ),

(2.16)

(cid:48)(z L

j ), and the

(2.17)

which is just (BP1), in component form. Next, we’ll prove (BP2), which gives an equation
for the error δl in terms of the error in the next layer, δl+1. To do this, we want to rewrite
j = ∂ C/∂ zl
δl

. We can do this using the chain rule,

j in terms of δl+1

k = ∂ C/∂ z l+1

k

δl

j =

∂ C
∂ z l
j

(cid:88)

k

∂ C
∂ zl+1
k

∂ z l+1
k
∂ zl
j

=

(cid:88)

k

∂ zl+1
k
∂ zl
j

=

δl+1
k

,

(2.18)

where in the last line we have interchanged the two terms on the right-hand side, and
substituted the deﬁnition of δl+1

. To evaluate the ﬁrst term on the last line, note that

k

zl+1
k =

(cid:88)

j

Differentiating, we obtain

wl+1

k j al

j + bl+1

k =

(cid:88)

j

wl+1
k j

σ(z l

j) + bl+1

k

.

(2.19)

∂ z l+1
k
∂ zl
j

= wl+1

k j

σ

(cid:48)(zl

j).
